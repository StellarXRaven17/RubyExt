When music is worked on, this txt file will list all the songs the Alphaver tracks replace, as well as the name of the tracks that replace them.

ONLY LENA RAINE SONGS ARE TO BE REPLACED (for now at least) (aside from music discs)

Please try to only use songs from the Cypress jar, which you can extract by changing the extension to .zip, opening it, and then going to sounddata\music
